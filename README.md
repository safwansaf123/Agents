ðŸ”¹ Agent-Level AI (One Response)
When you ask:
"What is the capital of France?"

ChatGPT responds:
"Paris."
Thatâ€™s like AgentAI: one decision, based on the current prompt only.

A basic AI agent that operates with limited scope. Usually rule-based or task-specific.
Example: A chatbot that responds based on fixed logic or a simple environment-reacting agent.

âœ… Use Case:
A rule-based AI agent that navigates in a 2D grid avoiding obstacles.


- Configuration is specific to that one agent
- Includes tools, prompt templates, memory, behavior settings

EXAMPLE
agent_math = AIChatAgent(
    name="MathHelper",
    tools=[calculator],
    behavior="Focus only on solving math problems."
)
agent_travel = AIChatAgent(
    name="TravelGuru",
    tools=[flight_search, weather_api],
    behavior="Give travel advice with weather updates."
)






ðŸ”¹ Run-Level AI (Session Management)
If you ask:
"Who is the president of the USA?"
"And what is his background?"

The AI remembers the context across your session â€” thatâ€™s like RunLevelAI, managing state or flow of information across a "run" (one conversation).
AI that adapts during a single execution (run) based on context or learning. More dynamic than agent-level.

Example: A Q-learning agent learning the best moves during execution.

âœ… Use Case:
A Q-learning agent navigating a maze and learning the best route over episodes.


- Applies only during one invocation of .run()
- Can temporarily override agent behavior or provide new instructions

EXAMPLE
result = agent_travel.run(
    "Find me cheap flights to Tokyo",
    overrides={"behavior": "Be super friendly and casual."}
)




ðŸ”¹ Global AI (Training + Learning)
When OpenAI trains models:
It looks at billions of chats
Learns patterns: what answers people like, what is accurate, what is harmful
Improves model weights
This is like GlobalAI: collecting data across many runs and adjusting for better global performance.

An advanced AI that coordinates multiple agents, systems, and learns over time across multiple runs. Can resemble a simplified AGI framework.

Example: A master control AI managing multiple learning agents (like in a simulated world or environment).

âœ… Use Case:
A controller that manages multiple Q-learning agents and evaluates them globally.


- Applies system-wide
- Useful for setting timeouts, API keys, logging, toolchains

EXAMPLE

config = RunConfig(
    timeout=20,
    logging_enabled=True,
    api_keys={"weather_api": "ABC123"}
)

agent_math = AIChatAgent(config=config)
agent_travel = AIChatAgent(config=config)






ðŸ”„ Summary: Mapping Game Example to Real AI
Game Python AI	ChatGPT/Gemini AI Role
AgentAI	One message â†’ one reply decision
RunLevelAI	Tracks the chat history for smart conversation
GlobalAI	Training the model over many chats


ðŸ‘¶ You're New? Here's the Takeaway:
Think of AI like nested brains:

Small brain = handles one moment â†’ Agent
Medium brain = handles one chat or game â†’ Run
Big brain = learns across thousands/millions of experiences â†’ Global

In large systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, or DeepSeek, all three layers exist:
Immediate answer (agent)
Chat memory or context (run)
Global model updates from learning (global)"# Agents" 
"# Agents"
